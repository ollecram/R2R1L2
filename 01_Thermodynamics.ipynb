    "# Thermodynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermodynamics is a phenomenological method whose object is to establish relationships between quantities that can be directly measured (such as pressure, volume, temperature, ion concentrations in a solution, intensity of electric and magnetic fields, luminous flux). This method does not rely on microscopic models of matter (molecules, atoms, ions, quanta). \n",

    "## Equilibrium states and Equilibrium Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "A thermodynamic system is a macroscopyc body in a state of *equilibrium* or close to equilibrium.\n",
    "A state of *equilibrium* is defined by the absence of gradients of any *macroscopic parameter* (pressure, density, temperature) within the volume occupied by that body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experience shows that under fixed *external conditions* a thermodynamic system that is not in a state of equilibrium tends to reach a state of equilibrium. This process if called *relaxation process* and the time it takes each system parameter to attain a constant value over the entire volume is called its *relaxation time*. The *total relaxation time* is the longest of the individual relaxation times. Calculating relaxation times is a problem of *physical kinetics*, thus extraneous to the realm of thermodynamics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A system may *move* from an *initial* state of equilibrium $A$ to a different *final* state of equilibrium $B$ as a result of the externally imposed change of some global parameter (pressure, volume, temperature). If the global parameter changes so slowly as to cause any appreciable difference only after a time longer than the relaxation time, the system effectively moves from $A$ to $B$ by traversing a succession of equilibrium states. The overall move from $A$ to $B$ is called an *equilibrium* or *quasi-static* process. The inverse path from $B$ to $A$ can be travelled by applying changes of the same parameter in the opposite order. For this reason, equilibrium processes are said to be *reversible*. \n"

    "### Graphical representation of states\n",
    "\n",
    "In thermodynamics, graphical representation of states is widely in use. For instance when dealing with a *homogeneous* body of matter (gas or liquid) occupying a volume $v_0$ and subject to a pressure $p_0$, that particular state  may be depicted on a cartesian $PV$ diagram as a *point* with coordinates $(p_0, v_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is implicitly assumed that *points* on such diagrams represent equilibrium states, the only ones for which system parameters have a definite value. In such diagrams, *equilibrium processes* are represented by continuous *lines* .  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following code produces diagrams illustrating equilibrium processes."
